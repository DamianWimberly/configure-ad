<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This lab demonstrates the process of setting up and configuring a Domain Controller and Client VM in Azure, integrating them into a functional Active Directory environment. The goal is to establish a domain, join client machines to it, and enforce security policies such as account lockout thresholds. Key tasks include configuring DNS settings, ensuring domain communication between the machines, creating user accounts and Organizational Units (OUs), and managing users' account security by locking and unlocking accounts based on incorrect login attempts. Finally, we will review event logs to observe security-related activities.<br />

<h2>Tutorial</h2>

**Setting Up a Domain Controller and Client in Azure**
---

ðŸ”· **Create a Resource Group**
- Ensure the virtual network and virtual machines are in the same region as the resource group.

ðŸ”· **Create a Virtual Network and Subnet**
- Attach this to the resource group for proper networking.

ðŸ”· **Create the Domain Controller (DC-1)**
- Image: Windows Server 2022 (at least 2 vCPUs)
- Name: DC-1
- Username: labuser
- Password: Cyberlab123!
- Virtual Network: Select the network created earlier, leave subnet as default.

ðŸ”· **Set DC-1â€™s Private IP Address to Static**
- This ensures the IP address remains fixed, which is necessary for DNS.
  - Azure Portal > Virtual Machines > DC-1 > Networking > IP Configuration > Set Private IP to Static > Save.

ðŸ”· **Disable the Windows Firewall on DC-1**
- Log in to DC-1 via Remote Desktop.
- Open `wf.msc` from the Run command.
- Go to **Windows Defender Firewall Properties**.
- Set the Firewall state to **Off** for Domain, Private, and Public Profiles.
- Apply the changes.

ðŸ”· **Create the Client-1 VM**
- Image: Windows 10 Pro (at least 2 vCPUs)
- Name: Client-1
- Username: labuser
- Password: Cyberlab123!
- Virtual Network: Select the same network used for DC-1, leave subnet as default.

ðŸ”· **Set Client-1 to Use DC-1 as DNS**
- Update Client-1â€™s DNS settings to use DC-1â€™s private IP.
  - Azure Portal > Virtual Machines > Client-1 > Networking > DNS Servers > Set to Custom and enter DC-1â€™s static private IP > Save.

ðŸ”· **Restart Client-1**
- This applies the new DNS settings.
  - Virtual Machines > Client-1 > Restart.

ðŸ”· **Ping DC-1 from Client-1**
- Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** on Client-1.  
- Run the following command to test connectivity:  
  `ping <DC-1-private-IP-address>`

**Deploying Active Directory**
---
ðŸ”· **Install Active Directory on DC-1**  
- Log in to **DC-1 via RDP**  
- Open **Server Manager**  
- Navigate to **Add Roles and Features**  
- In **Server Selection**, ensure dc-1 is selected  
- Under **Server Roles**, select **Active Directory Domain Services**  
- Confirm by clicking **Add Features**  
- Click **Install** and wait for the process to complete  

ðŸ”· **Configure Active Directory to become a domain controller**  
- Once Active Directory is installed, click **Promote this server to a domain controller**  
- Select **Add a new forest**  
- Root domain name: **mydomain.com**  
- Create a username and password  
- De-select **Create DNS delegation**  
- Click **Install** (Note: The server will restart)  
- After the restart, choose to log in as a domain user using:  
  `mydomain.com\labuser`  

ðŸ”· **Create Organizational Units**  
- Open **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**  
- Navigate to **mydomain.com**  
- Right-click on **mydomain.com** > **New** > **Organizational Unit**  
- Create the following Organizational Units (OUs):  
  - `_EMPLOYEES`  
  - `_ADMINS`  
  - `_CLIENTS`  

ðŸ”· **Create a Domain Admin user**  
- In **_ADMINS**, right-click > **New** > **User**  
- Create user: **Jane Doe** with the username: **jane_admin**  
- To make Jane Doe an admin:  
  - Right-click **Jane Doe** > **Properties**  
  - Go to the **Member Of** tab > **Add** > Enter: **Domain Admins**  
  - Click **Apply**  

ðŸ”· **Log out and log back in as Jane Doe**  
- Log out of **DC-1**  
- Log back in to `mydomain.com\jane_admin`  
- Use **jane_admin** as the admin account from now on  

ðŸ”· **Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)**  
- Log in to **Client-1** as the original local admin (**labuser**) via RDP  
- Open **System** > **Rename this PC (advanced)**  
- Click **Computer Name Change**  
- Under **Member of**, enter: **mydomain.com**  
- Click **OK** and restart **Client-1**  
- Log in to **DC-1** and verify that **Client-1** appears in **Active Directory Users and Computers** under **mydomain.com > Computers**  
- Move **Client-1** into the **_CLIENTS** Organizational Unit  

ðŸ”· **Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1**  
- Log in to **Client-1** as `mydomain.com\jane_admin` via RDP  
- Open **System** > **Remote Desktop**  
- Click **Select users that can remotely access this PC**  
- Add **Domain Users** > Click **OK**  

ðŸ”· **Create additional users and log in to Client-1**  
- Log in to **DC-1** as `jane_admin` via RDP  
- Open **PowerShell_ise as an Administrator**  
- Create a new file and paste the following [script](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1)  
- Run the [script](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1) to create users in the _EMPLOYEES OU  
Each user will have the default password: Password1 (this can be changed)  
- Use RDP to log in to Client-1 with one of the generated user accounts and ensure that log in is successful

**Managing User Account Security and Logs in Active Directory**
---

ðŸ”·**Dealing with Account Lockouts**
- Log into DC-1**
- Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
- Select a random user previously created in the **_EMPLOYEES** OU.
- Attempt to log into **Client-1** as the selected user with a purposely incorrect password **10 times**.
- Then, attempt to use the correct password: **Password1**.  
  You will notice that you can log in normally. Therefore, in the next steps, we will create a lock-out policy via Group Policy.

ðŸ”· **Configure Group Policy to Lockout Accounts after 5 Failed Attempts**
- Log in to **DC-1** as the admin user (**jane_admin**).
- Open **Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc)** via the Run command.
- Right-click **Default Domain Policy** under **mydomain.com** and select **Edit**.
- Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Account Policies** > **Account Lockout Policy**.

ðŸ”· **Set Account Lockout Policy**  
- **Account Lockout Duration**: Set to **30 minutes** (Time before a locked account unlocks automatically).
- **Account Lockout Threshold**: Set to **5 invalid logon attempts** (Number of failed logon attempts that trigger a lockout).
- **Reset Account Lockout Counter After**: Set to **10 minutes** (Time before the failed attempts counter resets to 0).

ðŸ”· **Verify the Policy**
- Log into **Client-1** as **jane_admin**.
- Open **Command Line** and run: gpupdate /force

ðŸ”· **Test the Lockout Policy**
- Select the same user and attempt to log in with purposely incorrect passwords.
- After the **5th** incorrect password, the account will lock, and a message will be displayed.

ðŸ”· **Unlock the User**
- In **DC-1**, open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
- Right-click **mydomain** and **Find** the user.
- Double-click the user, go to the **Account** tab, and select:  
**"Unlock account. This account is currently locked out on the Active Directory Domain Controller"**.
- To reset the password, right-click the user and select **Reset Password**.
- Attempt to log in again and observe that you now have access.

## Enabling and Disabling Accounts

ðŸ”· **Disable a User Account in Active Directory**
- In **Active Directory Users and Computers**, navigate to **_EMPLOYEES**.
- Right-click the user and select **Disable Account**.
- Attempt to log in to **Client-1** with the disabled account and observe the error message.

ðŸ”· **Re-enable the User Account**
- Right-click the same user and select **Enable Account**.
- Attempt to log in with the re-enabled account.

## Observing Logs

ðŸ”· **Observe Logs on DC-1 or Client-1**
- Log into **DC-1** or **Client-1** as **jane_admin** via RDP.
- Open **Event Viewer** (`eventvwr.msc`) > **Windows Logs** > **Security**.
- Observe the **Audit Failure** with **Event ID 4625**.
